Create a database to manage Grocery store data using MYSQL workbench .

Hi everyone!
I have created a database in MySQL workbench. 
The steps that I took in this project are as follows:
1) Analyzing data issues
2) Dividing data into categories
3) Creating a new database model
4) Adding the necessary tables
5) Creating an EER (Extended Entity-Relationship) Diagram
6) Database Testing With the creation of this database, I 
 learned how to address the data issues that existed previously. 
 Some of the advantages of creating a database are:

- Data is easier to understand because it is categorized
- Redundancy of data is eliminated, simplifying data collection.
- Collected data follows a consistent format.
- Inconsistent data input is avoided.
- Data can be easily integrated as needed.
